This file provides detailed information on the Kay Pho Du font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Kay Pho Du fonts

Basic Font Information
----------------------

design of Karenni (https://github.com/silnrsi/font-karenni). This is
currently a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are
preliminary and incomplete. They should not be used for creating
derivatives until a later release.
