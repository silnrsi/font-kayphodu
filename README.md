Kay Pho Du is a font for the Kayah Li script, based initially on the design of [Karenni](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-karenni). This is currently a work-in-progress, so these fonts and related files are preliminary and incomplete. They should not be used for creating derivatives until a later release.

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this font see [OFL-FAQ.txt](OFL-FAQ.txt).
