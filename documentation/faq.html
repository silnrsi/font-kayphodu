    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Kay Pho Du:</p>
    <h4 id="how-is-the-font-different-from-karenni"><em>How is the font
    different from Karenni?</em></h4>
    <p>Kay Pho Du is a freshly-drawn, new design based on the overall
    design of Karenni. Although the design is meant to be very similar
    to Karenni it is not identical and does not include any of the
    original outlines. Because of that, many of the glyphs are slightly
    different and the metrics are not the same. Many glyphs have also
    been added.</p>
    <h4 id="what-is-the-source-of-the-latin-glyphs"><em>What is the
    source of the Latin glyphs?</em></h4>
    <p>The Latin glyphs in Kay Pho Du are a new design specifically
    designed to work as a secondary script alongside the Kayah Li
    glyphs. They are not available as a standalone Latin design.</p>
    <h3 id="problems-with-bold-weights">Problems with Bold weights</h3>
    <h4
    id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs"><em>Why
    does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and
    dialogs?</em></h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold.
    To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using
    the application's UI controls such as a "B" button. See our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font Help
    Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold"><em>Why do I sometimes
    get a fake Bold?</em></h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), and
    then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications
    will make a "fake" Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the
    font (SemiBold, Bold). This is because only Regular has an
    associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with
    some apps and OSes. If you are using a weight other than Regular for
    text and want to make a word or phrase stand out, you will need to
    select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually. See
    our <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font
    Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
