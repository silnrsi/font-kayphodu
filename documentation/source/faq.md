Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Kay Pho Du:

#### *How is the font different from Karenni?*

Kay Pho Du is a freshly-drawn, new design based on the overall design of Karenni. Although the design is meant to be very similar to Karenni it is not identical and does not include any of the original outlines. Because of that, many of the glyphs are slightly different and the metrics are not the same. Many glyphs have also been added. 

#### *What is the source of the Latin glyphs?*

The Latin glyphs in Kay Pho Du are a new design specifically designed to work as a secondary script alongside the Kayah Li glyphs. They are not available as a standalone Latin design.

### Problems with Bold weights

#### *Why does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and dialogs?*

Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold. To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using the application's UI controls such as a "B" button. See our [Font Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families](https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/) for more information.

#### *Why do I sometimes get a fake Bold?*

If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), and then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications will make a "fake" Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the font (SemiBold, Bold). This is because only Regular has an associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with some apps and OSes. If you are using a weight other than Regular for text and want to make a word or phrase stand out, you will need to select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually.
